    "# SI 650 / EECS 549: Homework 3 Part 1\n",
    "## Introduction to PyTerrier \n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is intended to expose you to other types of information retrieval and demonstrates the use of another state of the art IR library, [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier). \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall learning goals of the assignment across all three parts are\n",
    "  - Learn how to use PyTerrier\n",
    "  - Understand how to train and use a Learning to Rank model\n",
    "  - Understand how to train and use a dense vector retrieval (using deep learning)\n",
    "  - Understand how to use document augmentation\n",
    "  - Gain additional programming and debugging skills when working with modern IR libraries\n",
    "  - Learn how to use the [Great Lakes cluster](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The Great Lakes cluster is a collection of high performance computers at the University of Michigan. The big advantage for this course is the ability to use its GPUs for doing deep learning. You will have access to this cluster for Homework 3 _and_ for your course project, which can expand the type of methods you can try. When launching jobs for this course, be sure to have your job use the `si650f21_class` account.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we'll be using the [CORD19 test collection](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge), which is a collection of documents about Covid-19 produced by AI2. In places, we've pretrained models and precomputed indices for you (which can take large amounts of time), but we'll ask you to try out the commands on a small scale so you'll know how to run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework 3 Part 1 will have you working on the following tasks to get you started:\n",
    "  - PyTerrier installation & configuration\n",
    "  - indexing a collection\n",
    "  - accessing an index\n",
    "  - using the `BatchRetrieve` transformer for searching an index\n",
    "  - conducting an `Experiment` \n",
    "\n",
    "For all parts of the homework, you can run them on your local computer with enough time. However, for Part 3, you will see *significant* speed up running these as notebooks on Great Lakes with a GPU. The three parts are designed to be completed in order, as they build on each other conceptually.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each notebook, all the tasks that you will need to complete are marked with **Task** in a cell title comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that just like Pyserini, PyTerrier also uses a Java-based  library underneath, [Terrier information retrieval toolkit](http://terrier.org), so you will need to set `JAVA_HOME` accordingly. underlying for many indexing and retrieval operations. PyTerrier is relatively new in 2020, but Terrier has a long history dating back to 2001 and  makes it easy to perform IR experiments in Python, which could come in handy for you when doing your course project.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [PyTerrier documentation](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for many more details."
